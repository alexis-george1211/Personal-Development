                                     <p>
                                        I am standing at 5 feet 5 inches and I weigh
                                        40 kilos. I have a black shoulder length hair.
                                        I have a round face with big brown eyes and two toned lips.
                                        I also have an overbite which explains
                                        the process of my braces. 
                                        Honestly, it's the moment
                                        frustrating thing to have. I don't often work out, only when 
                                        I find the time to, or when I feel like it. I run, but not 
                                        too much because I have asthma. But I can walk a great distance when 
                                        partnered with music! 
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                        I like to dress myself in layers, pretending 
                                        like I'm in Dead Poets Society or an old academia, 
                                        but due to the climate, I try to dress casually. You 
                                        wouldn't see me usually in a dress but sometimes I take liking
                                        in wearing them. 
                                        But I never liked to wear skirts. How ironic, right?

                                                I'm a person who likes to crave for knowledge
                                                but only at the expense of my own comfort. 
                                                I don't like to be forced to learn things 
                                                I'm not particularly interested in.
                                                But, I try my best to participate, especially in school.
                                                Which my main struggle is Mathematics. 
                                                Numbers are my main enemy when it comes to Maths. 
                                                But sometimes, if I focus hard enough, I would be able to understand it.
                                                It's not promised that I would be able to remember it
                                                the next day though!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                What I love studying most is English or anything 
                                                that involves Literature. If there's one place I'd be 
                                                grateful to be stuck with, it's definitely a libary. 
                                                It always excites me when one person references literary texts, 
                                                or when it's shown on lectures. I'm a total bookworm!
                                                To add to this, I am a huge literature nerd; I love essays,
                                                writing poems, analyzing songs, deep conversations, broadway theatres,
                                                annotating books, and giving 
                                                out speeches (if given enough time to practice). I also love 
                                                doing debates and understanding different sides. It always
                                                excites me when I wouldn't be able to get the side I'm aiming for. 
                                                It's funny to think so. But, with that, it helps me critically
                                                think. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But my weakest link
                                                would be impromptu speaking since I have a very foggy 
                                                brain when it comes to forming proper sentences in such limited time,
                                                let alone no time at all! I think fast but not in an orderly manner,
                                                so it would always hinder my formation of sentences. But, 
                                                to combat this, I can write what I think despite how 
                                                fast it is. So, in conclusion, don't put me in a 
                                                place where I have to think fast while also forming
                                                sentences out of my mouth. Especially in front of an
                                                audience. But this doesn't apply to my debating skills, though,
                                                thanks. If you tell me to think fast, my brain would immediately shut down.
                                                So, it's best to say to just leaving me alone to my thoughts 
                                                and let the pieces fall into place. Kidding!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I also take fun learning about psychology. I like 
                                                to navigate around individual behaviours to further
                                                and better understand why they do things the way they do.
                                                It also helps me learn things about myself that I have a
                                                hard time understanding as well. Which is why if I had given
                                                a third choice in college courses, it would be Psychology.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Speaking of college courses, my first choice would be Medicine.
                                                I love learning things about human anatomy and bodily functions.
                                                I want to know how to combat diseases and illneses. 
                                                It helps me stay motivated to learn about biological 
                                                aspects of human beings because in the end, I want
                                                to give people hope.
                                            </p>

                                                I also indulge in various hobbies that challenges my way of thinking, 
                                                which, currently, in coding. I love playing Sudoku, Wordle, Brain 
                                                Puzzles, and anything in New York Times Magazine that tickles my
                                                brain!

                                                All in all, I am confident that I am a fast learner.
                                                If I put enough focus on a material, I would be able
                                                to learn it by the end of the day.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In reference to my intellectual self, 
                                                        I have mentioned that I think fast that 
                                                        I wouldn't be able to keep track of it. 
                                                        Easiest way to explain it is, I have a 
                                                        head that's always running in marathons that speaks to me 
                                                        in jumbled things. Good things, bad things, any things.
                                                        That's why I keep a journal, though inconsistently, I would 
                                                        still be able to make up a thought.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        I'm not as open when it comes to asking for help
                                                        when I understand that a situation has become difficult for me to handle.
                                                        I've always feared abandonment when people
                                                        know what I'm going through.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        I have always felt like I am a lost person.
                                                        It's the heavy weight of feeling that I don't 
                                                        belong in places where I am now. I often feel like
                                                        I simply float around my circle of friends that I 
                                                        constantly find myself constantly staring at a distance. I often
                                                        find myself detaching from social gatherings to 
                                                        have a time of my own walking, thinking, talking. But, despite that, 
                                                        I remain thankful of my friends for being patient and sticking up to me. Though, 
                                                        I feel most guilty about it, I remain in gratitude for them.

                                                        I've always been a distant child, yet I remain 
                                                        open minded to understand that people are 
                                                        experiencing things that way I do. That's why I always 
                                                        fear of accidently putting out my anger on people who try to 
                                                        help me. In my understanding, being helped is a sign of
                                                        vulnerability, that I have allowed myself to be weak. But, I also
                                                        know that that isn't how it's supposed to be.

                                                        I express my emotios best in writing, music, sketching, 
                                                        or walking paces. I try to keep a healthy mindset 
                                                        that I know it will all work out in the end.

                                                                the sound of early morning birds, crickets at night. I dislike loud noises,

                                                                                        the same way I do with friends. I might be more reserved or 
                                                                                        just keep things on the surface rather than sharing a lot about myself. 
                                                                                        It’s not that I don’t care—it’s just that the bond isn’t the same as what I have with my friends.
                                                                                        In work or school settings, I try to socialize as much. I might still be a bit awkward, 
                                                                                        but I try to be responsible and put out an effort to be a leader for my
                                                                                        classroom and my obligtions at school. 
                                                                                        I won’t go out of my way to be the center of attention,
                                                                                        but I do my best when it matters.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                I see Him as a friend rather than just a figure of religion.

                                                                                                but I try to have faith that things will work out in the way they’re meant to. 
                                                                                                I find comfort in knowing that no matter what happens, I’m never truly alone.
                                                                                                My spiritual self isn’t about checking boxes or fitting into a mold—it’s about
